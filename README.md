# 🔐 Lagrange Interpolation - Secret Key Recovery Engine

> 🧠 Built with passion and precision during a high-stakes cryptographic hackathon challenge.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Java-based tool performs **Lagrange Interpolation** over large integers to reconstruct a **secret cryptographic key** (`c`) from partial `(x, y)` points. It supports input from a JSON format and handles arbitrary base-encoded values with precision using `BigInteger`.

---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Reads input from `inputX.json` files
- ✅ Parses values in various bases (binary, octal, decimal, hex)
- ✅ Implements Lagrange interpolation to find the constant term (secret `c`)
- ✅ Works with any threshold `k` number of points
- ✅ Accurate over very large integers using `BigInteger`
- ✅ Clean, modular, and ready for integration

---

## 🔢 Sample Input Format (`input1.json`)
```json
{
  "keys": {
    "k": 3
  },
  "1": { "base": "16", "value": "4D2" },
  "2": { "base": "10", "value": "1234" },
  "3": { "base": "2",  "value": "1010101010" }
}

## 📌 How It Works

> We reconstruct a secret `c` from partial polynomial values using **Lagrange interpolation at x = 0**:

```text
          ⎛          ∏   -xj ⎞
c = Σ yi ⎜ --------------- ⎟
         ⎝   ∏ (xi - xj)  ⎠
          j ≠ i             j ≠ i
```

No modulus. No limits. Just pure math.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steja3463/PolynomialEquation-Shameer_Secret_Sharing-
cd PolynomialEquation-Shameer_Secret_Sharing-
```

### 2. Download `org.json` library

Grab the latest `json-*.jar` from:
🔗 [https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json)

Place it in your project directory.

### 3. Compile and Run

```bash
javac -cp .:json-20240303.jar Main.java
java -cp .:json-20240303.jar Main
```

✅ Use `;` instead of `:` on Windows for classpath separation.
